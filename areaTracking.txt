Installing Git bash (instructions will be added after adding this to another station)


Setting up Git

Using Git to load the latest master data for immediate edits
(Note that merging several days of edits from several different work stations will not
be an option on Day 1. Load the master, edit it, post your edits.)
Commands that are to be run in Git Bash are preceded with a $
(The following commands only need to be run each time a different user wants to edit.
Initially we will have one user but may have many later.)
$ git config --global user.name "proxteamlead"
$ git config --global user.email srussell@renewalcolorado.com

Load the existing maps and notes to your desktop
(the path to the desktop will vary based on the work station you are using)
$ cd //rba-col-dc01/redirectedfolders/ccrowe/desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/renewalProxDenver/areaTracking.git
$ cd areaTracking

The previous command loaded the latest information on to the desktop into
a folder named areaTracking.

Go make your changes to the tracking map and then run these commands to
commit all of your daily changes with a message detailing the changes:
$ git commit -a -m "Update CC 5/1"
The commit message is held in quotes. Initially it may make sense
to include the team that did the update as well as the date it was updated

The previous line will not update the master file but only stage 
changes for the next command.
$ git push

At this point we may be prompted for username and/or password
user name: proxteamlead
password: Wedowindows1!

Assuming everything has worked then that is it. 
We have changed the master map, staged our edits, and then
posted our edits to the master file for other users.
