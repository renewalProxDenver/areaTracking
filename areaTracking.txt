Installing GitHub


Setting up Git

$ git config --global user.name "proxteamlead"
$ git config --global user.email srussell@renewalcolorado.com

Load the existing maps and notes to your desktop
$ cd //rba-col-dc01/redirectedfolders/ccrowe/desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/renewalProxDenver/areaTracking.git

The previous command loaded the latest information on to the desktop into
a folder named areaTracking.

Go make your changes to the tracking map and then run these commands to
commit all of your daily changes with a message detailing the changes:
$ cd areaTracking
$ git commit -a -m "Update CC 5/1"
(The commit message is held in quotes. Initially it may make sense
to include the team that did the update as well as the date it was updated)

The previous line will not update the master file but only stage the
change for the next command.
$ git push

At this point we may be prompted for username and/or password
user name: proxteamlead
password: Wedowindows1!

Assuming everything has worked then that is it. 
We have changed the master map, staged our edits, and then
posted our edits to the master file for other users.
