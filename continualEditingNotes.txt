This has the most basic information for using Git to help us maintain
a single map with all of our tracking information.
This will assume that Git is installed on the computer you are using
and that initial setup has been performed. If this is the first time
using these tools or processes please refer to the setupNotes.txt file.

We will try to limit the amount of users that can edit the master tracking
map because Git has issues reconciling edits made to maps. For this reason
a simple process will help us stay out of the woods when it comes to
using Git with our image data.

________
Basic synopsis of edit process:
1 Load the most recent data (pull)
2 Make all edits that you want to post
3 Commit all edits and push to the master repository (commit, push)

This process will fall apart if multiple users are working on the same
map at the same time. Therefore, one team should go through the process at a 
time

_______
Detailed synopsis of edit process:
1 Load the most recent data
Navigate to the folder that is under verson control and contains the
master tracking map to be edited.
This will commonly be done with the following command: 
**change "ccrowe" below to team leader first initial and last name; cgebhardt, etc**
$ cd //rba-col-dc01/redirectedfolders/ccrowe/desktop/areatracking

** Super important!!**
Make a copy of the map you have before pulling.
This may save loads of stress later if there was an error by another team.
If you do not have a file name copy please add one with the following command
$ mkdir copy
Now create a copy (with an optional date suffix) in an untracked folder:
$ cp trkNorthMaster.ptm copy/trkCopy[date].ptm

Now make sure you are working with the latest master map:
$ git pull

2 Make all edits that you want to post
Open the map from the areatracking folder. Make all edits and save the map.

3 Commit all edits and push to the master repository
Now simply commit your edits and post to the master.
$ git commit -a -m "[Team] update [date of update]"
$ git push
At this time Git may ask for username and password, so please enter them
to continue.

Now the info is ready for the next team to add their edits. As long as the
simple process is used we should avoid issues. Issues will develop if multiple
users pull the same map, create different edits, and then try to post.
Git is not designed for reconciling differences in images.

Now, any user or team that would like to review our most recent master
tracking map need only go to https://github.com/renewalproxdenver/areatracking
and open trkMaster.ptm in MapPoint.
