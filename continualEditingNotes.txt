This has the most basic information for using Git to help us maintain
a single map with all of our tracking information.
This will assume that Git is installed on the computer you are using
and that initial setup has been performed. If this is the first time
using these tools or processes please refer to the setupNotes.txt file.

We will try to limit the amount of users that can edit the master tracking
map because Git has issues reconciling edits made to maps. For this reason
a simple process will help us stay out of the woods when it comes to
using Git with our image data.

________
Basic synopsis of edit process:
1 Load the most recent data (pull)
2 Make all edits that you want to post
3 Commit all edits and push to the master repository (commit, push)

This process will fall apart if multiple users are working on the same
map at the same time. Therefore, one team should go through the process at a 
time
