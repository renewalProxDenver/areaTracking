Here are some notes on using MapPoint to better track our area.

When MapPoint is open make sure that the Drawing toolbar is available.
This can be toggled via the View drop down menu.
From there we have several different ways we can draw on the map
including free form, squiggle, and basic rectangles.
We also can add notes. Look for a colored rectangle in the Standard toolbar.
From there we can choose an icon, set a title for the note, and then add
whatever notes we deem valuable. For instance, I added a note in Boulder
that flags an area as subsidized housing, obviously a poor choice for canvassing.
Please add notes that will help generate more leads for the team when possible.
Notes can be minimized by pressing the X and then if we right-click the icon we can
show the information again.

All Denver maps will use a color scheme that is associated with months of the year.
This will be detailed in a different document. The color for area worked should
be followed rigidly. The color scheme for notes will be up for suggestion.
The fill color and the exterior color for any shape can be changed.

Shapes can be sent behind the roads by right-clicking the shape and then changing the
order to Send behing roads.
