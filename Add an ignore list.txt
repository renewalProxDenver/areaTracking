Here are some basic notes and instructions for adding an ignore list to your folder

The ignore list contains files and file patterns (folders, regex, etc.) that git
should not bother to sync.

We will be adding a copy folder that we can store different iterations in.
This will be used for data recovery in the case that there is a complication.

To create the file open git bash and enter the following commands:
$ cd [directory containing the areaTracking folder, usually looks like 
	//rba-col-dc01/redirectedfolders/ccrowe/desktop/areatracking]
$ touch git.txt
$ cp git.txt .gitignore
$ rm git.txt
$ echo "copy/" > .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ mkdir copy

Now we have added a file that will contain patterns that git should not bother with tracking.
We have added the copy folder to that file and now nothing we put in that folder will be tracked.
Any files that we have in that folder will only be stored on the local computer.

The only change now that we will have in our routine will be to create a copy of our map
before we pull the community changes.

This will be done with the following commands (navigating to areaTracking already assumed):
$ cp trkNorthMaster.ptm trkCopy[date].ptm
$ mv trkCopy[date].ptm copy/

And now we have a dated copy of our latest work saved in a local folder that we can access
in the scenario of data loss.
