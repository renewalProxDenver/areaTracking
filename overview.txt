Git is a version control system that is primarily useful for text files.
Text files that may be useful later would include text that help generate
maps, text that contains instructions like this document, text that
contains query info or other code that may be useful in generating
maps.
Git is designed for use with all the previously listed text files.
Maps are not text files but we can still use Git to help us distribute
a single master map that contains all group info.
To simplify our work with Git I propose we use Git primarily as
a central hub for the maps as well as a repository for any code that
we may use for generating the maps or queries that populate the maps.

When we are using Git to update the maps it may be best to keep the
process as simple as possible and limit the amount of people who use Git
to reduce sources of errors.

I will create two other documents that detail initial setup and then
routine Git execution after initial setup.
